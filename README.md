# Math24 Web App

## Overview
This is a simple web app for the game [Math 24](https://www.24game.com/). I was inspired to build it for my son who was introduced to the game by his math club.

The goal was to build a simple MVP over the weekend that could be progressively enhanced over time. Under the hood it utilizes Randall Reed Jr's [Math24 gem](https://github.com/randallreedjr/math24) which provides the problem generator and naive solver.

A live version is available at: https://math24-hjp.herokuapp.com

## Run
The app is written in Rails, run the following to start a local instance:

```bash
$ bundle

$ rails s
```
